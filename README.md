# Login app demo

This project consists of two pages, the home page(its protected) and the login page for granting access.

You only have one dummy user:

user: test@test.com
pass: test123

If you want to access any path it would redirect you to Home Page.

If you're not logged in, it would redirect you to Login Page

When logging in, it takes 2 seconds faking an API call.

### `npm install`
